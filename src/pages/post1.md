For this project I wanted to create a simple, navigable website to showcase my skills and accomplishments.
My target audience is potential employers and other professional contacts. It therefore seemed appropriate
to design my website to maximize the amount of information on the screen, without making it
overly dense, while minimizing the number of user actions needed to access desired information. The layout needed
to be clean and simple, without appearing archaic or lazy (an early iteration of my site had an early-2000's blog vibe). 
I also opted to use some more advanced styling and data management tools to make the website not just a billboard for my accomplishments,
but an accomplishment in and of itself. Ultimately, aside from its functionality, I created this website to introduce myself to the basics
of web dev. 

I decided to create my website within the Gatsby environment due to its provided hosting services, quality-of-life dev tools, and tutorials.
Gatsby also provided the framework for using GraphQL to access site data. With GraphQL, my site can automatically "transform" Markdown to HTML.
This allows me to create pages, like those describing projects, much easier. 

Most of my time, however, was spent learning the fundamentals of Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Although this isn't the first time I've worked with these languages
I'm now much more confident with the basics of how they operate and I believe I could whip up a fairly convincing website in a few hours. 

The biggest difficulties I encountered during this project were mostly related to Gatsby and React. Although these are both powerful tools, I think
it would have served me better to stick entirely to Javascript, CSS, and HTML, without bringing in somewhat unnecessary libraries and development
tools. The GraphQL functionality, for example, is interesting but superfluous for a basic website like the one I wanted to create.

In the future I would like to create another website, from scratch, without any external libraries or tools, to even better learn the fundamentals
of CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

In the meantime, I intend to keep slowly adding content to the site and beautifying it as I see fit.
